# Multi-Omics Factor Analysis v2 (MOFA+)

MOFA is a factor analysis model that provides a **general framework for the integration of multi-omic data sets** in an unsupervised fashion.  
Intuitively, MOFA can be viewed as a versatile and statistically rigorous generalization of principal component analysis to multi-omics data. Given several data matrices with measurements of multiple -omics data types on the same or on overlapping sets of samples, MOFA infers an interpretable low-dimensional representation in terms of a few latent factors.
