# bioFAM

Biology Factor Analysis Models (bioFAM) is a flexible framework for biological data analysis. Relying on a flexible graphical model, bioFAM enables users to model different assumptions for their data. Example usage is applying bioFAM to the datasets with multiple data types for the same samples or to multiple groups of samples or cells with same observed features (e.g. genes expression values).
