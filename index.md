## What is MOFA?

MOFA is a factor analysis model that provides a **general framework for the integration of multi-omic data sets** in an unsupervised fashion.  
Intuitively, MOFA can be viewed as a versatile and statistically rigorous generalization of principal component analysis to multi-omics data. Given several data matrices with measurements of multiple -omics data types on the same or on overlapping sets of samples, MOFA infers an **interpretable low-dimensional representation in terms of a few latent factors**. These learnt factors represent the driving sources of variation across data modalities, thus facilitating the identification of cellular states or disease subgroups.
