\usage{
getWeights(object, views = "all", factors = "all",
  as.data.frame = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a trained \code{\link{BioFAModel}} object.}

\item{views}{character vector with the view name(s), or numeric vector with the view index(es). 
Default is "all".}

\item{factors}{character vector with the factor name(s) or numeric vector with the factor index(es). \cr
Default is "all".}

\item{as.data.frame}{logical indicating whether to return a long data frame instead of a list of matrices. 
Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
By default it returns a list where each element is a loading matrix with dimensionality (D,K), 
where D is the number of features and K is the number of factors. \cr
Alternatively, if \code{as.data.frame} is \code{TRUE}, returns a long-formatted data frame with columns (view,feature,factor,value).
}
\description{
Extract the weights from the model.
