## Learning the basics

* [**Getting started**](https://github.com/bioFAM/MOFA2/blob/master/MOFA2/vignettes/getting_started.md): general overview and description of the method, for both R and Python users.

### R
* [**Training a model in R**](https://raw.githack.com/bioFAM/MOFA2/master/MOFA2/vignettes/getting_started_R.html)
* [**Downstream analysis in R**](https://raw.githack.com/bioFAM/MOFA2/master/MOFA2/vignettes/downstream_analysis.html)
* [**Gene set enrichment analysis**](https://raw.githack.com/bioFAM/MOFA2/master/MOFA2/vignettes/GSEA.html): demonstrates how to do gene set enrichment analysis in R.

### Python

* [**Training a model in Python (jupyter notebook)**](https://github.com/bioFAM/MOFA2/blob/master/mofapy2/notebooks/getting_started_python.ipynb)
* [**Downstream analysis in Python**:](https://github.com/gtca/mofax)

## Case examples (in R)
