\item{log}{boolean indicating whether to apply log transform}

\description{
BioFAM inference is done using the variational Bayes algorithm, which maximises a quantity called the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO).
The ELBO is supposed to increase monotonically up to convergence, but it can decrease substantially when dropping inactive factors.
For more details read the supplementary methods
The frequency of ELBO computation as well as the convergence criteria are defined as hyperparameters in \code{\link{prepareBioFAM}}. \cr
All Training statistics, including the ELBO, can be fetch from the training_stats slot of \code{\link{BioFAModel}} .
