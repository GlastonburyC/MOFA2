\title{Plot heatmap of relevant features}
\usage{
plotDataHeatmap(object, view, factor, features = 50, includeWeights = FALSE,
  transpose = FALSE, imputed = FALSE, sortSamples = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a \code{\link{BioFAModel}} object.}

\item{view}{character vector with the view name, or numeric vector with the index of the view.}

\item{factor}{character vector with the factor name, or numeric vector with the index of the factor.}

\item{features}{if an integer, the total number of features to plot, based on the absolute value of the loading.
If a character vector, a set of manually-defined features. 
Default is 50.}

\item{includeWeights}{logical indicating whether to include the weight of each feature as an extra annotation in the heatmap. 
Default is FALSE.}

\item{transpose}{logical indicating whether to transpose the output heatmap. 
Default corresponds to features as rows and samples as columns.}

\item{imputed}{logical indicating whether to plot the imputed data instead of the original data. 
Default is FALSE.}

\item{sortSamples}{logical indicating whether to sort samples using the corresponding values in the latent factor, rather than clustering. 
Default is FALSE.}

\item{...}{further arguments that can be passed to \code{\link[pheatmap]{pheatmap}}}

\description{
Function to plot a heatmap of the input data for relevant features, 
usually the ones with highest loadings in a given factor.
}
\details{
One of the first steps for the annotation of a given factor is to visualise the corresponding loadings, 
using for example \code{\link{plotWeights}} or \code{\link{plotTopWeights}}, which show you which are the top features that are driving the heterogeneity. \cr
However, one might also be interested in visualising the direct relationship between features and factors, rather than looking at "abstract" weights. \cr
This function generates a heatmap for selected features, which should reveal, im the original data space, the underlying pattern that is captured by the latent factor. \cr
A similar function for doing scatterplots rather than heatmaps is \code{\link{plotDataScatter}}.

\examples{
# Load example of BioFAModel
model <- loadModel(system.file("extdata", "model15.hdf5", package = "BioFAMtools"))

# Plot top 50 features for factor 1 in the mRNA view
plotDataHeatmap(model, "mRNA", 1, 50)

# Plot top 50 features for factor 1 in the mRNA view, do not show feature or row names
plotDataHeatmap(model, "mRNA", 1, 50, show_colnames = FALSE, show_rownames = FALSE) 
}
